MOTIVATION

The gentoolkit and gentoolkit-dev packages contain a collection of useful
administration scripts particular to the Gentoo Linux distribution. It contains
rough drafts and implementations of features that may in time make it into
Portage, or into full-fledged tools in their own right.

The gentoolkit-dev package is intended primarily for Gentoo developers.
